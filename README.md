"todolist.py" is a simple to-do list app that allows users to create, delete, edit, and mark tasks as complete. While it's not a fully finished project, I’ve learned a lot from working on it. The app also includes extra files, valid_users.csv and {name}_list.csv, which store the data needed for it to run. I’m looking forward to moving on to my next project and continuing to build my skills.

"week_3.c" is my week 3 project in which I tasked myself to reverse a string and reorder an array of numbers in numerical order using only what I have learned through code_acadamy and my notes. 

"Game.py(WIP)" is a spontaneous project I decided to work on when learning OOP. This work in progress is a game where your task is to defeat 8 bosses by answering math questions that will increase in difficulty.
