# James-Apprenticeship-CV
Please note that I'm learning, so my earlier projects are going to be a bit messy. Once I have some more projects under my belt, I can display the ones I'm proud of!

"todolist.py" is a simple to-do list app that allows users to create, delete, edit, and mark tasks as complete. While it's not a fully finished project, I’ve learned much from working on it. The app also includes extra files, valid_users.csv and {name}_list.csv, which store the data needed for it to run. I’m looking forward to moving on to my next project and continuing to build my skills.

"week_3.c" is my week 3 project in which I tasked myself to reverse a string and reorder an array of numbers in numerical order using only what I have learned through Code Academy and my notes. 

"Game.py(WIP)" is a spontaneous project I decided to work on when learning OOP. This is a game where your task is to defeat 8 bosses by answering math questions that will increase in difficulty. You can level up, upgrade stats and choose your actions during a fight. Two CSV files are required: user check and boss profile. The user check contains any existing user's name, and the boss profile includes the stats and other data related to the bosses. The final file, "James's_player_profile," is an example of data saved when a user saves their character.

"DocPro-S" is a project I'm currently working on, it's a document processing system for .txt files. I'm using my newly found knowledge of linked lists, stacks, queues, OS and shutil modules to create my project. I plan to add a File Manifesto, organise my file repository by date and much more. Here is a link to the git repository: https://github.com/SpoopyBlob/DocPro-S-WIP-very-early-stages-

"Contacts.c" is a small project I'm working on that will dynamically store contact information, name and number in memory. For a low-level language such as C, this will be a great learning experience for producing programs that allocate memory based on the program's needs.

"PhoneBook.py" in this project, I am just playing with hash maps and using separate chaining to deal with collision. Note: I use lists instead of arrays from the NumPy library.
