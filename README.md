# James-Apprenticeship-CV
Please note that I'm learning, so my earlier projects are going to be a bit messy. Once I have some more projects under my belt, I can display the ones I'm proud of!

"CLI Algorithm Vis" is my latest project. I'm creating an algorithm visualiser to help me understand algorithms. I will expand this project with more algorithms and features as I learn.

"PhoneBook.py" in this project, I am just playing with hash maps and using separate chaining to deal with collisions. Note: I use lists instead of arrays from the NumPy library. This is my cleanest project as I planned and focused on one element at a time.

"Game.py(WIP)" is a spontaneous project I decided to work on when learning OOP. This is a game where your task is to defeat 8 bosses by answering math questions that will increase in difficulty. You can level up, upgrade stats and choose your actions during a fight. Two CSV files are required: user check and boss profile. The user check contains any existing user's name, and the boss profile includes the stats and other data related to the bosses. The final file, "James's_player_profile," is an example of data saved when a user saves their character.

"DocPro-S.py" is an unfinished project; it's a document processing system for .txt files. I'm using my newly found knowledge of linked lists, stacks, queues, OS and shutil modules to create my project. I plan to add a File Manifesto, organise my file repository by date and much more. Here is a link to the git repository: https://github.com/SpoopyBlob/DocPro-S-WIP-very-early-stages- Note: This is a rough project, currently holds code that doesn't do anything yet.

"Contacts.c" is a small project I'm working on that will dynamically store contact information, name and number in memory. For a low-level language such as C, this will be a great learning experience for producing programs that allocate memory based on the program's needs.
