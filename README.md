"todolist.py" is a simple to-do list app that allows users to create, delete, edit, and mark tasks as complete. While it's not a fully finished project, I’ve learned much from working on it. The app also includes extra files, valid_users.csv and {name}_list.csv, which store the data needed for it to run. I’m looking forward to moving on to my next project and continuing to build my skills.

"week_3.c" is my week 3 project in which I tasked myself to reverse a string and reorder an array of numbers in numerical order using only what I have learned through Code Academy and my notes.

The final file, "James's_player_profile," is an example of data saved when a user saves their character.
