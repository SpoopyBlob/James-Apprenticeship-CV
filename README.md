"todolist.py" is a simple to-do list app that allows users to create, delete, edit, and mark tasks as complete. While it's not a fully finished project, I’ve learned a lot from working on it. The app also includes extra files, valid_users.csv and {name}_list.csv, which store the data needed for it to run. I’m looking forward to moving on to my next project and continuing to build my skills.
